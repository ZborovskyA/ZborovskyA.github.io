<h3> What was it that you did? </h3>
<p> For 3 summer's in a row I worked at the small golf course in the town where I lived. during this time I cut the grass, specifically the rough and fairways, I also worked cash, did basic landscaping, and socialized with the members or other custumers.</p>

<h3> When did you do it?</h3>
<p> The summers of 2020-2022. </p>

<h3> What was good about it?</h3>
<p> This job taught me so much, such as quick thinking, learning to be assertive, and making decisions on my own as it was such a small course on most days it would just be me and my boss working the course.</p>

<h3> What was your favourite memory of it? </h3>
<p> My favourite part was the members, every tuesday I would see the same group of them and we begun to build a bond. they were all very sweet and funny. I also enjoyed cutting fairways, everytime I cut a good one I would feel so proud and accomplished of myself.</p>

<h2> Coaching For My Own Highschool Swim Team</h2>

<h3> What was it that you did? </h3>
<p>During highschool I took the opportunity to be a assistant coach, I made and designed merch as well gave tips to help the swimmers improve with their stroke or flip/touch turns. </p>

<h3> When did you do it?</h3>
<p> I did this in the winter of 2019, on tuesdays and thursdays after highschool hours.</p> 

<h3> What was good about it? </h3>
<p> This was a fun experience, and I really enjoyed getting to design our teams clothing. The experience of having to do this taught me new communication skills and how to design with others in mind; which I had not done before this point.</p>

<h3> What was your favourite memory of it?</h3>
<p> My favourite memory of this experience was when I went to pick up the final product from the from the company that manufactured my design. I felt very proud of myself in this moment. </p>

<h3> What didn't you enjoy about it?</h3>
<p> Overall this was a very enjoyable experience for me, but I would say one thing I didn't particularly like was having to tell people what to do, or give pointers on how they could improve as I was not a pro swimmer myself. </p.>

<h3> Give your experience a letter "grade" </h3>
<p>This experience get an 'A'</p>
