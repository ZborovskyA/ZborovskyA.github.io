<h2>I Organized Guided Tours for the new Highschool</h2>

<h3> What was it that you did?</h3>
<p> I took a course called leadership twice in highschool. The second year our volounter hours were encouraged to come from helping in some aspect with our new school that everyone would be moving to in the following semester. My group partner and I decided we wanted to assist with the tours and planning with that. We were tasked to organize and set up walk through guided tours for every class in our Highschool. </p>

<h3> When did you do it?</h3>
<p> I did this in of December 2020.</p> 

<h3> What was good about it? </h3>
<p> This helped me improve my quick thinking skills, for example when I had 7 classes lined up outside the front doors at one time when only 3 should be given the amount of room available. As well forcing me out of my shy and quiet shell to make sure everyone was welcomed and understood where/what they were doing. </p>

<h3> What was your favourite memory of it?</h3>
<p> I thought it was so cool that my classmates and I got to </p>

<h3> What didn't you enjoy about it? </h3>
<p> this was right when we all started to come back to school after the covid break so it proofed to be more challenging, there was restrained on how many students could be in this not fully developed school yet, rules on how close the tours groups could get to each other, as well as the obvious highschool students guiding other highschool students around and unsupervised not fully finished school. Although I think the hardest part was having to boss around my class mates (they were the tour guides) when they were not listening. </p>

<h3> Give your experience a letter "grade" </h3>
<p> This memory gets a 'C'. It was fun but not I'd do it again fun.</p>
