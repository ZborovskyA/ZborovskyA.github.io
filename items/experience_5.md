<h2>Art Camp Volunteering</h2>

<h3> What was it that you did?</h3>
<p>One summer a volunteered at a little Art Camp where I live. I helped supervise the children adn helped them with anything they needed.</p>

<h3> When did you do it?</h3>
<p>The summer of 2018.</p>

<h3> What was good about it? </h3>
<p> It was nice to do something I enjoy (art related tasks), and help children learn adn express themselves. </p>

<h3> What was your favourite memory of it?</h3>
<p>My favourite memory was watching the kids make and preform their own plays, I got to see them express themselves and use their creativity.</p>

<h3> What didn't you enjoy about it? </h3>
<p> Kids have very high energy adn short attention spans, so it was difficult getting them to focus at times. </p>

<h3> Give your experience a letter "grade" </h3>
<p> I would rate this experience a solid 'B', I was fun but I would not have done unless i needed the volunteer hours for highschool.</p>
