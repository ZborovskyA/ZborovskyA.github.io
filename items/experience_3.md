<h2> Being A Cottage Cleaner/Maid</h2>

<h3> What was it that you did? </h3>
<p>Being a house and cottage cleaner was my first job, I cleaned for a small family business as well as my elderly bosses home. </p>

<h3> When did you do it? </h3>
<p> I had this job for the sumer of 2019.</p>

<h3> What was good about it? </h3>
<p>Having this job helped me get out of my comfort zone and learn how to new skills. Without this job I would not have gotten my following and favourite job at their other business. </p>

<h3> What was your favourite memory of it? </h3>
<p> Unfortunately my favourite part about this experience in my life was getting paid, this was not a glamourous or enjoyable job by any means. </p>

<h3> What didn't you enjoy about it? </h3>
<p> I saw, smelt, and cleaned a bunch of gross stuff I will never forget. I especially hated cleaning up after the groups of hunters that would stay for a few weeks every summer, there was always a large mess to clean.</p>

<h3> Give your experience a letter "grade" </h3>
<p> This job definitely gets a 'F', I would not recommend anyone a maid job unless the pay is good enough. Although they are a lovely family I still keep in touch with them, and help out when needed. </p>
