<h2> My Favourite Job </h2>

<h3> What was it that you did? </h3>
<p> For 3 summer's in a row I worked at the small golf course in the town where I lived. during this time I cut the grass, specifically the rough and fairways, I also worked cash, did basic landscaping, and socialized with the members or other custumers.</p>

<h3> When did you do it?</h3>
<p> The summers of 2020-2022. </p>

<h3> What was good about it?</h3>
<p> This job taught me so much, such as quick thinking, learning to be assertive, and making decisions on my own as it was such a small course on most days it would just be me and my boss working the course.</p>

<h3> What was your favourite memory of it? </h3>
<p> My favourite part was the members, every tuesday I would see the same group of them and we begun to build a bond. they were all very sweet and funny. I also enjoyed cutting fairways, everytime I cut a good one I would feel so proud and accomplished of myself.</p>

<h3> What didn't you enjoy about it? </h3>
<p> A difficult part of my job was dealing with drunk people or tournaments. Essentially these are the same thing but tournaments mean more people to deal with. </p>

<h3> Give your experience a letter "grade" </h3>
<p> Overall this job was great and I will never forget my time there, therefore I give it an 'A'.</p>
